Documentation
-------------

`scoutz` is a Ruby on Rails V3 application for the management of BSA Scouting units. `scoutz` is in no way associated nor endorsed by the [Boy Scouts of America](http://www.scouting.org).

Install it, play with it, let me know what you think.

API? You betcha! Any registered user can access a `scoutz` application and perform all actions they are authorized to perform in the html version.

Mobile? That too. But mobile will have to take a seat in the back of the bus for a while.

Coming: `scoutz` will be hosted on a real live site, freely available to the interweb's cosmonauts.


Getting Started
---------------

It is assumed you have created and served a Rails application before. If you have not, the official [Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) would be a good place to start learning more.

Please note that `scoutz` was written with the intention of being hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). This includes:

* Assets hosted on a CDN, like [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* Served using [thin](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin)
* All assets will be precompiled and *not* committed to the repository (except manifest.yml)


Technologies
------------

Some of the gems `scoutz` is using:

* Compass and SASS - for sanity
* Twitter Bootstrap - via twitter-bootstrap-rails gem
* Devise - authentication
* Cancan - authorization
* Carrierwave - uploads
* delayed_job - the ole' standby
* sextant - will be in rails 4, let the goodness roll for 3.X
* exception_notification - hard to beat free excpetion emails
